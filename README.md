Create Empty Parent at Center
📌 Overview
This Unity Editor tool allows you to create an empty parent at the true center of selected objects, instead of using their pivot points like Unity’s default "Create Empty Parent" does. This ensures better grouping, alignment, and scene organization when working with multiple objects.

🚀 Why Use This?
🔹 Default Unity behavior creates the parent using the pivot points of selected objects, which may not always be ideal.
🔹 This tool calculates the true center based on the bounding box of all selected objects instead.
🔹 Maintains object hierarchy while allowing precise organization.
🔹 Automatically renames and selects the new parent, so you can quickly edit it.

📥 Installation
Option 1: Import the Unity Package (Recommended)
1️⃣ Download the CreateParentAtCenter.unitypackage from the repository.
2️⃣ In Unity, go to Assets → Import Package → Custom Package....
3️⃣ Select CreateParentAtCenter.unitypackage and click Import.

Option 2: Manual Installation
1️⃣ Download CreateEmptyParentAtCenter.cs from the repository.
2️⃣ Place it inside your Unity project’s Assets/Editor/ folder.
3️⃣ Open Unity, and the tool will be available in GameObject → Create Empty Parent at Center.

🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Select multiple objects in the Hierarchy.
2️⃣ Click GameObject → Create Empty Parent at Center or use a custom shortcut (if assigned).
3️⃣ A new empty parent is created at the calculated center of the selected objects.
4️⃣ The selected objects are automatically reparented under the new empty GameObject.
5️⃣ The tool automatically highlights and renames the new parent, making it easy to edit.

📌 Features
✔️ Creates an empty parent using object bounds, not pivots.
✔️ Maintains hierarchy & keeps relative positions intact.
✔️ Automatically selects and renames the new parent for quick editing.
✔️ Works with all object types, including meshes, UI elements, and non-mesh objects.

🎯 Usage Example
Imagine you’re working with multiple props, environment assets, or UI elements. Instead of manually adjusting a new empty parent:
✅ Select objects → Click "Create Empty Parent at Center" → Done!

The new parent is now at the true geometric center of the selected objects, making it easier to manipulate and align them.
